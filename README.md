# Company-Network-Design
I'm happy to share my recent Cisco Packet Tracer project, Company Network Design, in which I created and set up a safe and effective corporate network. Important points to note are: OSPF Routing Protocol, VLAN &amp; Inter-VLAN, Subnetting, DHCP Server, SSH, NAT, Access Lists, Port Security
